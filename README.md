# Unemployment Analysis (2019-2023)

# Overview
This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of unemployment data from 2019 to 2023, a period marked by significant global events, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. The data was extracted from a PostgreSQL database using SQL queries and subsequently visualized using Power BI to uncover critical insights into the demographics most affected by unemployment.

# Project Structure
unemployment_analysis.sql: This file contains SQL queries designed to extract key unemployment data from the PostgreSQL database. The queries are structured to identify the year with the highest unemployment rate between 2019 and 2023 and to analyze which race, gender, and age groups were most impacted during this period.

Power BI Visualization: The data extracted through SQL was visualized using Power BI. These visualizations include a series of bar charts and graphs that illustrate unemployment trends, shedding light on the specific demographics most affected by unemployment.

# Tools Used
PostgreSQL: SQL queries were employed to extract and analyze data from a PostgreSQL database, providing a detailed view of unemployment trends across different demographics.
Power BI: This tool was used to create visualizations that highlight the insights derived from the data, allowing for an interactive exploration of unemployment trends.

# Key Insights
Year with Highest Unemployment Rate: The analysis revealed that 2020 had the highest unemployment rate, a direct consequence of the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This spike in unemployment reflects the widespread impact of the pandemic on the global economy, particularly in the United States.

Most Affected Race: The data indicated that the Black population was the most affected by unemployment during this period. This finding underscores the disparities in economic impacts across different racial groups, highlighting the need for targeted economic support and policy interventions.

Gender Disparities: Men were more affected by unemployment than women during this period. The reasons behind this could be linked to the types of industries hit hardest by the pandemic, such as manufacturing and construction, which traditionally employ a higher percentage of men.

Age Group Analysis: The data analysis also included insights into which age groups were most affected by unemployment, offering a nuanced understanding of how different demographics were impacted.

# How to Use
SQL File: Execute the unemployment_analysis.sql file in your PostgreSQL environment to extract the relevant unemployment data.
Power BI Visualization: Import the extracted data into Power BI to create dynamic visualizations, allowing you to explore the insights and trends in unemployment rates across various demographics.

# Conclusion
This project not only provides a detailed analysis of unemployment trends from 2019 to 2023 but also offers critical insights into the socioeconomic factors contributing to these trends. The findings highlight the disproportionate impact of unemployment on certain racial groups and genders during a period of global crisis, emphasizing the importance of inclusive economic policies.
